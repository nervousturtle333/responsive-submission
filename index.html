        <p class = "segment-title">  Project Introduction </p>

        <p class = "body-text">
            For this project, I chose the homepage of <a href="https://www.palestineremembered.com/index.html" target="_blank">Palestine Remembered</a>
            to redesign and restructure.
            I chose this website because it is an archive of Palestinian history and villages that were raided and
            ethnically cleansed. It serves as a resource of compiled documents, stories, and narratives that are often
            unheard of and on the verge of erasure.

    <!-- Challenges Identified -->

    <div class = "segment-pink">
        <p class="segment-title"> Identifying Challenges in Original Website </p>
        <p class = "body-text">
            Upon inspection of the Palestine Remembered website, I identify the following challenges:
        </p>

        <div class= "segment-subtitle" >
                Usability
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class= "body-text" >
            This webpage overwhelms users with the number of buttons and options available.
            Having both the vertical and horizontal nav bars results in inefficient
            user directions. Additionally, multiple buttons and links are redundant and are not
            grouped efficiently. It is also unclear how to switch between languages.
        </div>

        <div class= "body-text" >
            When resized, the vertical navigation bar becomes a hamburger which is more effective.
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class= "segment-subtitle" >
            Learnability
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class= "body-text" >
            Due to having many different options to select from and the frequency of redundant buttons and links,
            the website becomes more difficult to learn as multiple paths take to similar links and pages. However,
            navigating the back button with the two navigation bars is difficult and confusing.
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class= "segment-subtitle" >
            Memorability
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class= "body-text" >
            Most pages the main page links to are similar in structure and elements. Additionally, the majority of
            the text and boxes do not indicate possible interactive elements. Therefore, the website loses memorability
            because of repetition and confusion. The two navigation bars are also easy to confuse. The layout for all
            page sections is identical and not visually seperated.
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class= "segment-subtitle" >
            WAVE Accessibility Findings
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class= "body-text" >

                <li> 70 Missing alternative texts </li>
                <li> 43 Very low contrast </li>
                <li> 3 Unordered Lists </li>
                <li> 40 Layout tables </li>
        </div>
        </br>
        <div class="body-text">
            Palestine Remembered mainly struggles with layouts and displays on the screen, as indicated by the many
            table layouts found. As evident by the presence of unordered lists, the website also seems to need a better
            hierarchy and organization.  Additionally, The contrast between the colors is incoherent and low. Lastly,
            there is a large dependency on icons and list items, however, most of them do not have appropriate alternative
            text.

        <p class = "segment-title">  Lessons Learned </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Throughout this project, I experimented with grids and flex boxes to handle page layout.
            I also explored intentional programming and design for different-sized screens.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Most importantly, however, I learned the importance of value-based work that revolves around giving back
            and protecting indigenous communities whose existence is constantly denied and fought.
